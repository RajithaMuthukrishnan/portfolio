# GitHub Pages Configuration

This file helps GitHub Pages understand how to serve your site.

## Site Configuration

- **Source**: Deploy from a branch
- **Branch**: main
- **Folder**: / (root)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain, create a `CNAME` file in the root directory with your domain name.

Example:
```
yourdomain.com
```

## Build Process

This is a static site that doesn't require a build process. GitHub Pages will serve the files directly.

## File Structure

Make sure your main page is named `index.html` and is in the root directory.

## Troubleshooting

If your site isn't loading:
1. Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
2. Verify all file paths are correct
3. Ensure there are no syntax errors in HTML/CSS/JS
4. Check GitHub Pages settings in your repository

## Performance Tips

- Optimize images before uploading
- Minify CSS and JavaScript for production
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Test your site locally before deploying
